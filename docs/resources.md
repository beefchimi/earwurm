## Additional context

This library was partly inspired by [`Howler`](https://github.com/goldfire/howler.js). Some API decisions were made to closely match the `Howler` implementation. This should hopefully make switching from `Howler` to `Earwurm` easier for some consumers.

The last time the `Howler` codebase was referenced for this library:
